# hello-world
my first repository
Today is traditional Chinese new year's Eve and not until a few minutes ago did I find out this fact. I've been too unsensible about time as I've been trying running from the real  world and wasting time since I graduated from college. My fearness and confusion about future increase as I stay in my room trying to avoid people I know or as I'm just being lazy. And all this has to stop now.
